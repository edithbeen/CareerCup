# a k-palindrome string is a string which transforms to a palindrome if at most k character is removed
# given a string s and an integer k, write a function that returns Yes if it is a k-palindrome, otherwise No
# S has at most 20,000 characters, 0<k<=30

# This is too hard. I don't know the answer now

l = range(1, 6)
p = range(5, 10)
d = dict(zip(l, p))

print(d)
print(d[1])
